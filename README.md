# chipmunk

A messy functional library for Lua.

**Warning:**  `chipmunk` is intentionally _mutable_ and predominantly _uncurried_ to keep things performant for gamedev.  If this bothers you, or is not your intended use-case, I suggest trying [flintinatux/squirrel](https://github.com/flintinatux/squirrel) instead.
